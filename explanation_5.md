# BlockChain Explanation
I used a linked list for the blockchain as it allowed constant time insertion and lookup for the most recently added block. Runtime of functions (not including __str__ convience function) is O(1).  __str__ function has runtime of O(n)
The space complexity is O(n) as we are storing every input in a linked list and this list could grow with every transaction (add block command).
