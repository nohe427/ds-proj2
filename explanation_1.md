# LRU Cache Explanation
For the LRU Cache I chose to use a dictionary and a linked list for the internal structure of the cache.  The dictionary was chosen for its near constant time lookups of O(1). This could take me directly to a known pointer for an object if it existed so I could then act upon that pointer. I additionally chose to use a linkedlist to organize the state of the cache for its constant time insertion and deletion methods. I would rearrange the list whenever I would utilize a known value in the cache and I would remove the last element in the list whenever the cache size was exceeded.  The overall runtime is O(1). The space complexity of the LRU Cache is O(n). n in this case represents the capacity of the LRU cache.
